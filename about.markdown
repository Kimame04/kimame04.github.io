# Hi there! I'm Kieran Mendoza 👋🏽

I come from the Philippines but I've stayed in Singapore for 13 years and counting! Here are some things that I am a fan of:

- Productivity 📒
- Coding 🔢
- Aviation 🛩️
- Dungeons and Dragons 🐉

# Schoolwork 🏫

I'm currently studying in NUS High School of Math and Science, and I'm taking Math, Physics, Chemistry and Computing Studies as my 4 majors! Find my study notes here:



I'm also the President of my Co-Curricular Activity, Youth Flying Club! We make anything related to aviation, from gliders, to planes and quadcopters!

# My Strengths 💪🏽 :

I am very:

- Driven
- Committed
- Organised
- Meticulous

# My Goals

Right now, here is what I want to achieve:

1. A clean, clutter-free workspace
2. Learn, in-depth, about these topics:
   - Deep Learning & Neural Networks
   - Fluid Dynamics

Here are my long-term goals:

1. Become an aeronautical engineer (either that, or a researcher in the field)
2. Become an essentialist and minimalist

**I want to leave the world better than it was before I arrived.**
