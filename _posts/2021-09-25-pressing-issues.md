title: What are the most pressing problems in the world today?

Climate change is very much real. It has a profound impact on our lives today. Global warming, rising sea levels, extinction of wildlife are merely the symptoms of a dying Earth, and we are to blame for it. Greenhouse gas emissions are at an all-time high, and other irresponsible practices like fracking and sewage disposal systems only exacerbate the impact climate change will have on us.

In 2020 where the coronavirus pandemic is frequently at the front of our minds, terrorism has fallen into the sidelines. However, we must not turn away from this looming threat just yet. Hundreds of lives have been taken by insurgents yearly, along with causing political and social instability and opening rifts in our social fabric. 

Be it gender, race or income inequality, the world needs solutions to all of them, and quick. Evidence is showing that the gender equality movement has more or less stalled and the pay gap between socio-economic classes is rising quickly. To state some figures by the UN Foundation, 82% of the wealth generated in 2017 went to the richest 1%. 

The world's population is skyrocketing, but the global food supply cannot match such a dramatic growth rate. The result â€” a possible dystopia in the future when a significant amount of the world's population is malnourished. Currently, a billion people in the world suffer from a degree of food insecurity, and this figure is bound to rise in the coming years.
